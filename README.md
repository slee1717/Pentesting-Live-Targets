# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

It is possible to look up whether a user exists or not by using the login form. A bolded "Log in was unsuccessful" message represents that the user exists, while a plain message means that the user doesn't exist.


Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Malicious javascript code could be submitted via the contact form on the site. An admin logging into the site to view the contact form entries would activate the script.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: __________________
